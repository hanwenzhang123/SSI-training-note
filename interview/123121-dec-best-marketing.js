CSS:
margin collapse
highlight getElementByClass, nth-child
Javascript:
pass params to function
filter function / how about if we want to change instead of return a new arr
react:
state props different
props cannot be changed
context or redux to pass data
virtual dom: how it works. 
react lazy loading
npm start vs npm build
deployment
arr of component: missing a key
any question: samples -> about project, about team, about sprint.

Ways to improve web performance
Coding challenge:
1.A function taking two numbers as arguments. Return true if the sum of any digit in num1 is equal to num2. (e.x. 100365, 8 => true, because 3 + 5 = 8)
2.Use React to implement a calendar (using December 2021 as data set)
