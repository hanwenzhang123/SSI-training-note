Notes:
Em is depended on the parent, rem don’t care about the parent
Absolute will not follow its parent if the parent has the default position or the static position. Default position of every element is static.
Fixed is based on the viewport when doing the left 20px right 40px.
Sticky is like fixed but it’s relative to its parent not the view port.
