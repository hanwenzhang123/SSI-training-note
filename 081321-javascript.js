//Functionality: lexical scoping with “this” keyword
//the key word "this" behaves differently in arrow functions compared to a regular function.
//Lexical Scope allows inner functions to access the scope of their outer functions, but not the other way around
//In a nested group of functions, the inner functions have access to the variables and other resources of their parent scope.
//the child's functions are lexically bound to the execution context of their parents.
