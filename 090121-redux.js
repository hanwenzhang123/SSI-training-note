Lifting State Up vs Composition vs Inheritance
//Lifting State Up
enable children components to have better smooth communication among each other
//Composition
{props.children} - built-in method, pass down as property children
//Inheritance
not a good model to use in React


//Redux
a library for managing react
component tree talks to each other through layers, local state pass down to props
redux has a store, like a database
